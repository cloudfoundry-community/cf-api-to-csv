# cf-metrics config & setup
the only configuration requirement is that the cf-metrics binary is run from a shell that has recently logged into cloud foundry via `cf login` and that said logged-in user has proper permissions.

# output
the binary will output a csv file for each org and space in the foundry inside of a directory called "output"
